### Source Code

<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>**UPDATE**</B></FONT><BR>
I have updated some small errors, and commented the project file some. And better servers
<BR><BR>
I did read that PSCode didn't want articles just linking to another site, but I don't see any other way.<BR><BR>
Look at the end to see the link.<BR><BR>
It will guide you trhough creating a fully working OCX. I have also included the project of the OCX in the compressed file (in the future this project will be more commented).<BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://hjem.get2net.dk/birk-jensen/pscode/ocx.zip">This is the compressed file (located on another server than pscode)</A><BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="1">Hope you enjoy reading the article, and I will try to keep on posting more stuff like this article in the future.<BR><BR><BR>
